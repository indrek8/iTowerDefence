# iTowerDefence - Tower Defense Learning Project

## Overview

This is an experimental **desktop tower defense-style game** built using **Godot (GDScript)**. The primary goal of this project is to **learn and explore** game development while experimenting with **AI-powered debugging and development tools**.

## Project Focus

- Learning **Godot 4** and **GDScript**
- Experimenting with **AI-assisted debugging and game design**
- Exploring mechanics of **tower defense gameplay**
- Testing **macOS compatibility**, with possible future expansion to Windows

## Status

This project is primarily for **learning and experimentation**. It may not be fully playable or completed, as the focus is on **gaining experience rather than building a finished product**.

## Planned Features

- Basic **tower defense mechanics** (waves, enemies, and towers)
- AI-assisted debugging & level design experiments
- Simple **UI and game interactions**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Godot Engine 4.x** (Download from [Godot's official website](https://godotengine.org/download))
- A macOS system (Windows support may be considered later)
